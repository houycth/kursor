## What does this program do? 
Control mouse cursor movement through keyboard, simulate left/right click, simulate wheel rolling.

## Why does this program exist?
My mouse is broken, and I do not want to remember too many keyboard shortcuts. Mouse control is more intuitive.

## Why not the mouse control program provided by Windows?
The control program of Windows relies on numeric keypad. My keyboard DOES NOT HAVE IT!!!!!

## How does this program work?

### Start and stop
I provide you with 2 extremely efficient ways to start:
1. Double-click kursor.exe(There will not be any prompt or pop-up after this operation. You can proceed to the next step directly — refuse pop-up window, start from this.);
2. Click F7 on the keyboard to enable mouse control.

At this point, you can enjoy using this program!(The program does not take effect indicates that this program is not applicable for your computer. It is recommended that you try again with a different computer if you insist on using it.)

At the same time, I provide you with a variety of ways to stop this program.
1. Kill this process through the terminal;
2. Find kursor.exe throuth Task Manager and then click Stop Task;
3. Reboot your computer.

Either of these methods terminates the program directly. There are absolutely no resident processes.

### Shortcut
| Shortcut | Description |
|  ----  | ----  |
| F7 | Enable/Pause |
| KeyA | left |
| KeyD | right |
| KeyW | up |
| KeyS | down |
| KeyJ | left mouse button |
| KeyL | right mouse button |
| KeyI | wheel up |
| KeyK | wheel down |
| KeyQ | Reduce cursor movement speed |
| KeyE | improve cursor movement speed |

## System/Feature/Performance Test
|  Items   | Result  |
|  ----  | ----  |
| Compatible systems | My computer with Windows10 22H2 |
| Feature | Should be no problem |
| Performance | It's smooth I feel. |

## Known bugs
1. When enabled and cursor is in the Device Manager. the cursor would slowly move to the lower right corner of it until the cursor exceeds the range of the Device Manager.
2. When enabled and move the mouse slowly up or to the left, the cursor position rebounds slightly.(Why use this program when you already have a mouse?)


## Plans for future updates
I want to make this program the greatest program of this century!

But now it has encountered a huge difficulty and has had to suspend the development plan — I've got a brand new and full-functional mouse!!!!!!
